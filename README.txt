This project was a lot of fun to code!

I learned the basics of Python on my own last winter vacation, but this was my first time actually using the language. Please keep that in mind :)

How to run the program:
1. Install Python 3: Open terminal and type 'python' to check the version is newer than 3.4, or download Python from the official website.
2. After cloning the repo, 'cd' into the folder and create a virtual environment:
    Mac/Linux: '$ python3 -m venv env'
    Windows: '$ py -m venv env'
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    Mac/Linux: '$ source env/bin/activate'
    Windows: '$ env\Scripts\activate'
4. Install additional packages: '$ pip install requests'
5. Run the program in terminal: '$ python main.py'

I also learned some Flask, but I wasn't able to finish making a website; I was only able to implement asking for username input and displaying a tweet.
You can take a look on the branch 'flaskApp'.

How to run the Flask program (assuming you've done steps 1-4 above):
1. Install Flask: '$ pip install Flask'
2. Run the program in terminal: '$ flask run'
